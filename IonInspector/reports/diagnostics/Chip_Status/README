Chips may still perform within specification when Noise or Gain alarms are present!

 Gain - Info Only

Measurement of the ability of
the chip to sense the change
in pH of the pixels during
flow of W2 during chip
calibration.

 Reference Electrode - Alert

The reference electrode
brings all the pixels in to
range. It does this this by
putting a voltage on the
fluid (w2) to bring it to
the middle of the ISFET (ion
sensitive field effect
transistor) range. This
allows all the transistors
to operate at the same
voltage.

==============================================================================

This test flags runs with low ISP loading.

OK indicates that loading was >= 70% and is not a significant concern.
Warning indicates that loading is >= 40% and < 70% and should be investigated if there are no other more obvious problems.
Alert indicates that loading is < 40% and may be indicative of some other problem with the run.

Loading is defined as the number of wells with ISPs detected divided by the number of total usable wells.
It should be the loading number in the report as seen by the user.

Projected reads based on thumbnail output. Full chip reads may vary +/- 15%.
