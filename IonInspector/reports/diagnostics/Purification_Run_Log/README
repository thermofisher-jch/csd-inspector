This report renders three time series graphs.   
* The large upper graph is for temperature reading
* The middle smaller graph reports on three fans (one System, two Cooling) and a Cooling pump
* The bottom smaller graph reports the remaining three time series, which as of yet seem to mostly consist of a long run of zero's.
  Sometimes one or two values will appear.  Thesee cover (allegedly) "Light", "Quant", and "Stepper" metrics.

-- It is not quite clear what the distinction is between Ambient 1 and Ambient 2 in the temperature measurements.

* It was recently observed that there are occasional runs up to several minutes long where the source for this report has no data.
  Changes were made in the 1.8 release to surface that obseration for this report.  Generally, the default graph will show discontinuity 
  between line segments when more than 25 seconds have gone by without a value reported between two adjacent data points.  There is a checkbox
  in the lower-right corner of the graph that may be used to restore an earlier interpolated view that provides line connectivity between
  any adjacent data points, regardless of their distance.

* Visibility of inidividual instrument feeds can be enabled or disabled usign the checkboxes on the far right.  When the mouse is placed over
  the graph itself, the visibility controls are replaced with a legend that reports the time and currenet values for all visible feeds closest
  to the mouse's currenet position.  While in this view, the color labels are sorted to match the order of the lines from top to bottom.  The
  line closests to the mouse cursor is highlighted and should stand out from the rest.  It's legend label is also highlit for easy correlation.
