S5
---
The S5 pressure should be 7.2 <= p <= 8.8 if the target pressure is 8.0.
The S5 pressure should be 10.4 <= p <= 10.6 if the target pressure is 10.5.

Proton
---
The Proton pressure should be 7.8 <= p <= 8.1 if the target pressure is 8.0.
The Proton pressure should be 10.2 <= p <= 10.8 if the target pressure is 10.5.

PGM
---
The PGM pressure should be 9.5 <= p <= 11.

The PGM temperature should be 26°C <= t <= 34°C.

For ideal Ion PGM™ Instrument operation the PGM Site Prep guide recommends an ambient room temperature of 20-25°C (68-77°F).
Note: The room temperature should not fluctuate more than 2°C over a 2-hour period.
