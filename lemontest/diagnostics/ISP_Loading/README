This test flags runs with low ISP loading.

OK indicates that loading was >= 70% and is not a significant concern.
Warning indicates that loading is >= 40% and < 70% and should be investigated if there are no other more obvious problems.
Fail indicates that loading is < 40% and may be indicative of some other problem with the run.

Loading is defined as the number of wells with ISPs detected divided by the number of total usable wells.  
It should be the loading number in the report as seen by the user.
