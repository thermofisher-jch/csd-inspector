Filter Metrics test shows results of applied software filters:

  Library well categories show percentage of Library Beads (from Basecaller output):
    Valid         - reads pass all filters, saved and passed on to further analysis
    Polyclonal    - fail polyclonal filter
    Bad key       - key signal doesn't match either library or TF keys.
    HighPPF       - percent positive flows over accepted software threshold
    High residual - fitting residual over accepted software threshold
    Zero bases, Short, Filtered - fail length filters before or after trimming

  Loaded well categories show percentage of Bead wells (from Separator output):
    Library - library key found
    TF      - TF key found
    Dud     - No signal, excluded from analysis
    
  Primary well categories (from Separator output):
    Beads   - beads
    Empty   - empty
    Pinned  - pinned values, excluded from analysis
    Ignored - excluded from analysis based on poor or bad behaved signal
