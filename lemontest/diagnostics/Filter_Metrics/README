Filter Metrics test shows results of applied software filters.  [Readme Last Updated 2014.2.13]
 
 
Library Well Categorization (filters are displayed in the order which they are applied by the Basecaller analysis):
                "Low Quality: High PPF" – wells identified as "high percent positive flows" by polyclonal filter, which is a murky category that may contain either polyclonal ISPs with >2 sequences or just very low quality ISPs.
                "Polyclonal" – wells identified as polyclonal by the polyclonal filter. 
                "Low Quality: Bad Key" (formerly known as "Bkgmodel keypass") and "Low Quality: Failed Keypass" (formerly known as "failed keypass") - both refer to reads that were discarded because their key sequence did not perfectly match. We do this check twice, once in Signal Processing ("Low Quality: Bad Key") and another time in BaseCaller ("Low Quality: Failed Keypass").
                "Low Quality: Short Read" - reads discarded, because BaseCaller called less than 4 bases (beyond key & barcode).
                "Primer Dimer" (formerly known as "adapter trim") - reads discarded because adapter trimming reduced the side of the read below 4 (beyond key and barcode).
                "Low Quality: Quality Trim" - reads discarded because quality trimming (based on sliding-window average of phred qv scores) reduced the size of read below 4 (beyond key and barcode).
                "Final Library ISPs" (formerly known as "valid") - whatever reads survived the above filters and were saved to BaseCaller's output file (unmapped BAM or SFF in earlier versions).
 
                Note: The above filters are binned together in the sequencing run report as their naming implies.  (This means that all of the Low Quality reads are totaled and displayed as the number of "Filtered: Low Quality" and percentage of the total Library ISPs.  The same is true for "Filtered: Polyclonal", "Filtered: Primer Dimer", and "Final Library ISPs").
               
Loaded well Categorization:
                Library – ISPs with library key
                TF – ISPs with TF key
                Dud – ISPs with no key or key  cannot be reliably determined
 
Primary well categorization:
                ISPs – wells with ISPs (that did not pin or were ignored)
                Empty – wells without ISPs (that did not pin or were ignored)
                Pinned – "pinned wells" are wells where A/D converter went out of range. These wells are not processed.
                Ignored – corner wells not fluidically addressable
